## About

This recommendation system utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze user behavior and preferences, generating recommendations for products that users are likely to be interested in. By leveraging the power of data and algorithms, the system enhances user experience and increases engagement with the platform.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains information about user interactions with products, such as purchases, ratings, and browsing history. The dataset will be preprocessed and used to train the recommendation algorithms.

## Features

- **Collaborative Filtering**: Implementing collaborative filtering techniques to generate recommendations based on user-item interactions.
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Utilizing content-based filtering to recommend products similar to those previously liked or interacted with by the user.
- **Hybrid Approach**: Combining collaborative and content-based filtering methods to enhance recommendation accuracy and coverage.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Assessing the performance of the recommendation system using metrics such as precision, recall, and mean average precision (MAP).

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook (for data exploration and model development)

## Getting Started

To get started with the recommendation system, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file using pip.
3. Download the dataset from Kaggle and place it in the `data` directory.
4. Explore the dataset, preprocess the data, and develop recommendation algorithms using Jupyter Notebook or your preferred IDE.
5. Evaluate the performance of the recommendation system using appropriate evaluation metrics.
6. Fine-tune the models and parameters to optimize recommendation accuracy and relevance.
7. Deploy the recommendation system to production or integrate it into your application for users to access.
